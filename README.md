# BackUpDatFilesYo
<br>
When all you need to do is simply mirror your files to another folder or external harddrive. Don't give greedy companies your hard earned money for something so simple!
<br>
<h2>Instructions For Use:</h2>
<br>
Put the folder you wish to backup in this line <b>sources.append("C:\\FolderToBackup")</b>.
<br>
Then put the location(eg. external harddrive) you wish to mirror those files to in this line <b>mirrors.append("B:\\MirrorFolder")</b>.
<br>
<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<br>
I'm fairly new to Python, the code might be slightly sloppy. But it works. Feel free to make improvements upon it if you can!
