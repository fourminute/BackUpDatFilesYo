When all you need to do is simply mirror your files to another folder or external harddrive. 
<br>
Mirrors the contents of two folders to exactly match one another using a 'source' folder as reference. 
<br>

<b>Features</b>

  * MD5SUM of existing files before overwriting(saves time).
  * Easy-To-Use folder dialog boxes.
  * Automatically creates directories if they don't exist, filling in the gaps.

<h2>Instructions For Use:</h2>

I'm fairly new to Python, the code might be slightly sloppy. But it works. Feel free to make improvements upon it if you can!
